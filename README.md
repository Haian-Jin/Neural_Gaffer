# Neural Gaffer: Relighting Any Object via Diffusion (code coming soon)

## [Project Page](https://neural-gaffer.github.io/) |  [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2Ymf3BC-nT4CW4GvVft1g7OrRd0f0rV/view?usp=drive_link)
Neural Gaffer is an end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model that accurately **relights any object in a single image under various lighting conditions**.

Moreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model enables many downstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object insertion. Our model can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such as relighting a radiance field.
