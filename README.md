# Neural Gaffer: Relighting Any Object via Diffusion (code coming soon)

## [Project Page](https://neural-gaffer.github.io/) |  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07520)
Neural Gaffer is an end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model that accurately **relights any object in a single image under various lighting conditions**.
Moreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model enables many downstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object insertion. Our model can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such as relighting a radiance field.
